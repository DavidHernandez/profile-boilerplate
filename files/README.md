# Files folder
 There are you folders in this folder:
 * public: is the public files folder. The deploy script will link this folder to sites/default/files. If your site uses another folder, you will need to update the deploy.sh script.
 * private: if your site uses a private files folder, will be located in this folder. By default is commented on the deploy script, you will need to uncomment it. You will also have to specify the location of the private files folder in Drupal (by default, sites/default/files/private).
