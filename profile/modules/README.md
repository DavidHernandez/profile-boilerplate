## Modules
In this folder is where we store most of our custom code and Drupal specific configuration exported to features. It contains three subfolders:
* custom: Our custom code.
* features: Our modules with the configuration, created with the Features module.
* hacked: The contrib modules that we have modified will be copied into this folder.
